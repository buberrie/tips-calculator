## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javasript

### What I learned

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
Most part of the Javascript was a whole new learning experience for me, it was fun, tasky, confusing at some poit but im happy I was able to get it done

### Continued development

I will keep working on my Javascript knowledge, how to give instructions and as well my css knowledge.
